# Origyn Starter

Welcome to your new origyn_starter project. This template has been customized with Motoko, React and Material UI.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with origyn_starter, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/languages/motoko/)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)
- [React Reference](https://reactjs.org)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)

## Requirements

- Install the following version of the DFINITY Canister SDK

```
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
```

- NodeJS >=16.0.0

## Get Started

With Git and credentials:

```
git clone https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_starter.git
```

With Git and SSH:

```
git clone git@github.com:ORIGYN-SA/origyn_starter.git
```

With NPM:

```
cd og_starter
npm install
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
